# Toilet-Access-System
This is a proposed system for schools to make accessing the toilets easier.


<p>The system uses HTML and JS but requires a SENTRAL API KEY.</p>
#features.
Features are; 
  Students need to scan their Sentral ID card to access the toilet.
    + If students don't have an ID card there is a button for requesting staff approval.
    + A staff approval feature for students that require it.
  Student report feature that is only avalible after the door closes for a certain amount of time.
    + A staff menu for seeing reports and adjusting blacklists of students

#How to use
<p>This system is designed for a tablet style device to be mounted on a wall next to the door connect with an electromagnet through an arduino to the tablet device.</p>
<p>  > Physcial devices include an electromagnet, button for signalling the server, an arduino, and a touchscreen capable device.</p>

#Main updates and To dos.



#Development rants.
Eventually in the future I'd like to make a proper server based system where each Kiosk isnt running its own server but connect to a central server which just uses configs and an SQL server to control the door locks, But im not 100% sure how i'd do it and make it practical with the electromagnet needing its own pc/controller.
