This is a proposed system for schools to make accessing the toilets easier.


<p>The system uses HTML and JS but requires a SENTRAL API KEY.</p>

#How to use
<p>This system is designed for a tablet style device to be mounted on a wall next to the door connect with an electromagnet through an arduino to the tablet device.</p>
<p>  > Physcial devices include an electromagnet, button for signalling the server, an arduino, and a touchscreen capable device.</p>

#Main updates and To dos.



#Development rants.
Eventually in the future I'd like to make a proper server based system where each Kiosk isnt running its own server but connect to a central server which just uses configs and an SQL server to control the door locks, But im not 100% sure how i'd do it and make it practical with the electromagnet needing its own pc/controller.
